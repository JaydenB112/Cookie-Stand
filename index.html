        Do you like cookies? Do you like fish? Now those might seem like two completely unrelated and even averse food topics, but guess what? We're bringing these two worlds that where perfectly fine before together to create this abomination! Now buy our cookies and look at this happy family, we fully understand nothing good can come from this, but the FDA ignored the signs of the catastrophic effect these cookies could have on humanity because we use buzzwords like "environment","edible",and "FDA approved"! Just wait until these bad boys hit the market, a couple funny tiktoks and we'll probably be a global phenomenon. This is a direct result of your actions, consumer, we aren't evil by nature, but we are the culmination of divine wrath which you so desperately ignored!
